[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/ "AngularJS") is a JavaScript MVC (Model View Controller) created by Google. It is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. This is well-suited for single page apps. AngularJS isn't the first MVC on the scene, you may have heard of the like of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.js"), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/ "Ember.js") or [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/ "Knockout.js"). However, AngularJS does the best job of adapting your HTML for dynamic views.

AngularJS is fully extensible and plays well other libraries. It is easily modified and each feature can be adjusted or replaced for your unique project needs. AngularJS defines many concepts to organize your web application properly. It takes HTML to the next level by extending the HTML Vocabulary for your application. It does this by enhancing the HTML by attaching directives with new attributes, tags and expressions, allowing you to define powerful templates directly in your HTML. Your application behaviors are encapsulated in controllers that are instantiated due to dependency injection. Because of this dependency injection, AngularJS helps you structure and test your JavaScript code much more easily.

I hope that this wets your appetite to find out more about this amazing framework. We will take a deeper look into the specific features of AngularJS in future posts. Please check back for more info.
