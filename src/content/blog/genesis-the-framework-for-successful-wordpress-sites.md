In my last post, I explained some of the reasons [Why I use WordPress](/web-development/wordpress/top-5-reasons-to-use-wordpress-for-small-business-websites/ "Top 5 Reasons that I use WordPress") to design and develop websites and blogs.  For the last few years I have been creating custom templates from scratch, using bare themes like Starkers or Boilerplate.  This gave me complete control over what I put in the theme and how I put it there.  Though I created some great themes for my clients, It was a lot of work and I had to make sure that I included every element needed.  In addition, as WordPress created updates and added features, I had to go back to my themes and update them to ensure that they continued to work seamlessly with the new versions of WordPress.  Now I know what you're thinking, "Why don't you just make child themes?".  Well yes, I had read about child themes, and I had even created a couple of child themes, but I didn't feel like I had complete control and I didn't like the idea of having to purchase a parent theme framework.  Recently my brother, [Jonathan Jeter,](http://www.jonathanjeter.com/ "Jonathan Jeter - Web Guru") introduced me to the [Genesis Theme by StudioPress.](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=241369&u=599433&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack=)  The Genesis Framework changed everything and opened my eyes to the world of WordPress child theming.

Genesis is now the foundation for my WordPress design and I will tell you why:

## 1\.  Genesis is Search Engine Optimized

Even though WordPress already does a good job in the SEO department, Genesis' state of the are code and amazing architecture make it super easy for search engines to index your site.  Genesis also provides automatic updates so as the search engine game changes, so does Genesis.  Your site will always be fully optimized and up to date.  They also provide tutorials and recommendations for the do-it-yourselfers out there, so anyone can achieve better search engine results.

## 2\.  Genesis Gives you State-of-the-Art Security

Since WordPress is the most widely used CMS on the internet today, WordPress websites have become a target for those idiots out there that like to cause trouble by taking your site down or exploiting it for malicious reasons.  Trust me, having your site hacked sucks! It can be expensive and time consuming to fix, and your reputation can be permanently damaged.  The Genesis team brought in security industry experts to ensure that it has the best security possible.

## 3\.  Genesis Lets You Update Your Site Instantly

Updating my custom Themes used to take hours, after each WordPress update.  Not updating wasn't an option, due to security risks and new features.  Genesis takes care of the update for you.  They make updating the latest version of WordPress simple.  They test all updates thoroughly so you don't have to.  Just click one button and done!

## 4\.  Genesis Makes Customizing Your Site Incredibly Easy

Genesis gives you features to make your site exactly the way you want it, simply.  Just a few of the features include:

- widget ready
- tons of theme options
- great comment functionality
- ready for advertising
- auto-sized featured images
- and many many more

## 5\.  Genesis has Custom Widgets

Genesis has been widgetized way beyond the sidebar.  This enables them to develop custom widgets that you can use almost anywhere on your site.  In addition, the large community of developers that use Genesis have created many plugins, specifically for Genesis, that add even more functionality to your site.

## 6\.  Genesis has Layout Options

With six built in layouts, Genesis gives you the ability to mix and match layouts.  You can use any or all of them on your site, even individually by page or post.  Let me make this clear, You are no longer limited to one layout for your entire site!  Or limited to the hassle of creating custom templates to create different layouts.  These layouts are selectable in the theme options or on the individual pages and posts.

All of this adds up to my new way of creating websites for WordPress.  Be sure to look for my Genesis Child Themes for sale, coming soon to [Head Turning Media](http://www.headturningmedia.com/ "Head Turning Media - Get Your Business Noticed!").  To get your own copy of [Genesis by Studio Press](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=241369&u=599433&m=28169&urllink=&afftrack= "StudioPress Themes for WordPress"), click on the banner below.
