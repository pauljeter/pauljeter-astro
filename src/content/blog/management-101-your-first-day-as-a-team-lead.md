So, it’s day one in your new role as a team lead. First off—congrats!

If you’re coming in from outside the company, your brain’s probably spinning from back-to-back onboarding meetings, figuring out the Wi-Fi (seriously, who has the password?), and maybe realizing you’ve left your badge behind for the third time before lunch. If you’ve been promoted from within, you might be riding a wave of pride—or wondering how things are going to shift now that you're managing people who were recently your peers. Can you still hang out with Jim and Ana on the weekend?

Depending on how much heads-up you had before starting, you might have a game plan for your first week. But it’s completely normal if you’re unsure what your actual output looks like now. You’re not shipping code or closing JIRA tickets anymore. Instead… you’re doing *manager stuff*. But what exactly is that?

The reality is that every company handles management differently. Maybe you’ve worked under a calm, methodical manager who preferred writing things down over chatting face-to-face. Or maybe you’ve had an energetic, idea-sparking manager who was great at inspiring but all over the place in execution. Or maybe you had one who just… wasn’t around.

So what *should* you be doing? Let’s break down a structure that helps you settle in, find clarity, and build momentum right from the start.

## 1. Introduce Yourself—Properly

Make it personal. That means face-to-face if you’re in the same space, or at the very least a video call if your team is remote. Don’t default to Slack or email. Even if you’ve met some of the team during the hiring process, this is the time to start building trust.

During your intro chats, ask:

- What’s the team working on?
- What’s going well?
- What’s not working?

You’ll quickly start to learn a lot, like:

- What projects are in flight—and whether the goals are clear
- Who’s accountable for what decisions (or if that’s unclear)
- How folks feel about the company and the team
- Whether the team feels seen and supported
- How they feel about the work they’re doing right now

You can start with one-on-ones or group sessions—go with what feels natural based on the people and the setting. Either way, take notes. These early insights are gold.

## 2. Schedule Weekly 1:1s

This is non-negotiable: carve out weekly 1:1s with each person on your team.

They’re your most important meeting—where honest conversations happen, trust is built, and growth begins. Start with an hour per person. It might seem long, but trust me, the time flies, especially early on.

If your company already has a strong 1:1 culture, great. If not, ask your team to give it a shot. Done right, it becomes the foundation of how you support and grow your people.

## 3. Set Up a Private Doc for Each Person

You’ll want a place to track everything that comes up in those 1:1s: action items, feedback, goals, and follow-ups.

Create a private document—shared with just you and the individual. It can be as simple as a Google Doc. Use it to:

- Track discussion topics as they arise throughout the week
- Document what was said and what needs to happen next
- Revisit ideas that you might want to follow up on later

Over time, you’ll get better at sensing what to address in the moment vs. what to park for the next 1:1.

## 4. Don’t Forget Your Own 1:1s

Set up a recurring weekly 1:1 with your manager. Don’t wait for them to make the move—just get it on the calendar.

Use the same structure: create a private doc where you capture updates, questions, and takeaways. Whether or not your manager uses it, you’ll be better prepared.

Timing matters too. A Monday 1:1 sets you up for a forward-looking week. A Friday one helps reflect and wrap. Pick what works best for your rhythm.

---

## 5. Frame the Current State

Ask for access to recent reviews or performance summaries for your direct reports. Understanding where each person is coming from helps you meet them where they are.

Look for:

- Strengths and areas for growth
- Existing goals or development plans
- Any known challenges or red flags

This gives you great material to explore in your early 1:1s.

---

## Why Do All of This?

Because this is the framework you’ll operate in as a manager:

- Frequent, informal face time
- Weekly private conversations that build connection
- Consistent documentation and follow-through
- A clear view of each person’s goals and challenges

It’s not flashy, but it’s effective. You’re laying the foundation for a healthy, high-trust team.

Next up, we’ll go deeper into those first 1:1s and introduce a concept called **Contracting**—a great way to set mutual expectations with your direct reports right from the start.
