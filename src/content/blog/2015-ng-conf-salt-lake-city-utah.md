The 2nd annual ng-conf was recently held in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was a great couple of days of learning and networking. Many thanks to all of the organizers and to all the sponsors who made it possible. I have published a series of posts documenting my notes from the sessions. If they are helpful, or you enjoy reading them, please share, link back and leave a comment below.
