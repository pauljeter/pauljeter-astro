The 2nd Annual Front Porch Front End Developers Conference was recently held in Dallas, Texas at the Granada Theater. It was a great day of learning and networking. Many thanks to [Chris Willams](https://twitter.com/amboy00) and [Mina Markham](https://twitter.com/MinaMarkham) for organizing this year's event and to all the sponsors who made it possible. I have published a series of posts documenting my notes from the sessions. If they are helpful, or you enjoy reading them, please share, link back and leave a comment below.
