## It’s that time of year again…

Let’s be honest—no one *likes* performance reviews.

They’re the dentist visit of management: necessary but uncomfortable. Yet if you approach them well, they can be one of the most powerful tools you have to help your team grow. Done right, they motivate your top performers and guide your strugglers toward improvement. Done poorly, they lead to confusion, frustration, or worse—surprise.

In this article, I’ll share the approach I use with my own direct reports. Many of them have adopted similar strategies with their own teams, and over time this method has spread—so I like to think it’s working.

## Preparation

Block an hour for the meeting. But before that, block an hour for the preparation.

Yes, really—*an hour per person*.

That may sound like a lot, especially if you’re juggling other responsibilities or managing a large team. But these reviews carry weight, and they’re one of the most impactful things you’ll do as a manager all year. Being unprepared sends a message: “You weren’t worth the time.”

Good prep lets you:
- Deliver precise, thoughtful feedback
- Avoid saying something you’ll later regret
- Show your direct report that you value their contributions

Clear your schedule. Bring your A-game.

## No Big Reveals

Always share your written review before the meeting.

No one likes walking into a conversation not knowing what’s coming—especially if the feedback is tough. Sharing the review ahead of time lets people process it emotionally and intellectually *before* they’re across the table from you.

Why does this help? Because people receiving difficult feedback often go through five stages:
1. Ignore  
2. Deny  
3. Blame others  
4. Accept responsibility  
5. Work on solutions

By sending the review early, steps 1–4 can happen in private. That means your actual meeting can focus on step 5—*how to move forward*.

## Get Feedback from Others

Your view is just one perspective. Peer and cross-functional feedback adds depth and balance.

For each report, I reach out to at least two people who work closely with them—inside or outside their immediate team—and ask a few questions:

- What’s it like working with them?
- What are their biggest strengths?
- What could they improve?
- What’s your favorite moment working with them recently?
- Do you want this feedback to be anonymous?

In my experience, most people are happy to be named—which is a great sign of trust within the team.

---

## Who Writes the Review?

Here’s where I get a little opinionated:

> Staff shouldn’t write their entire review. That’s your job.

If someone’s underperforming, they likely won’t reflect that accurately in a self-review. And contradicting them can make the meeting harder than it needs to be.

Instead, treat it as a collaborative document:
- They write about their achievements and reflections.
- You write your evaluation and observations.
- You both use the meeting to discuss, align, and plan ahead.

---

## How I Prepare

My personal prep looks like this:

1. **Review team outcomes** during the period.
2. **Scan 1:1 notes** for milestones, themes, or concerns.
3. **Reflect on emotional tone**—were they stressed, engaged, coasting?
4. **Think about the future**—what stretch goals or growth areas make sense?

That gives me enough to write something meaningful and tailored. No templates, no guesswork.

## What I Put in the Review Document

Even if your company provides a standard format, here are the sections I use:

- **Key achievements** (looking back)
- **Development areas** (looking forward)
- **Peer feedback summary** (verbatim or anonymized)

I aim for 500–1000 words per person. That might sound long, but it sends a clear signal:  
*I took the time. I care about your growth.*

I include space for their comments—either clarifications, additions, or rebuttals. I’m not always right, and sometimes they see things I missed.

I share the document at least a day before the review and ask them to read it thoughtfully before we meet.

---

## The Meeting

Check for comments before you meet.

Then show up as your best self: calm, open, and ready to listen.

Don’t just read through the document. That’s a waste of time. You’ve both already read it. Use the meeting to:

- Celebrate the wins
- Discuss the challenges
- Talk about next steps and growth areas
- Set or refine goals for the next period

Roughly half the meeting should be reflection; the other half should be future-focused.

Sometimes it’ll be smooth. Sometimes it won’t. If emotions run high—anger, tears, frustration—stay grounded. Don’t backpedal on the critique, but do offer support. Give space, listen with empathy, and remind them that feedback comes from a place of care and belief in their growth.

---

## Leave Compensation Out of It

If you’re also announcing raises, *don’t do it in the performance review meeting*.

As soon as money enters the picture, people stop listening to feedback. Their mind flips to one of two places:
- “Awesome! Holiday time!”
- “That’s it? Are they serious?”

Either way, your carefully prepared feedback gets sidelined. Deliver comp changes separately—ideally in writing first, so they can digest and come back with questions if needed.

---

## In Summary

Performance reviews are tough—but they’re also a golden opportunity.

They’re your best chance to reflect, align, challenge, and inspire. When done well, they reinforce trust and give your team a clear path forward.

They’re not just another meeting.  
They’re your headline show.

So rehearse. Show up. Bring your best.  
And help your people grow.

Good luck.
