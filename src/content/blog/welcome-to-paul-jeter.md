Hello, my name is Paul Jeter, and this is my blog. As the title suggests, I am a Graphic Designer, Web Developer and Photographer. On this site you will find tutorials, news, techniques and freebies from me and the great sites that I follow. I plan to show you how I design and develop websites & print media, and take & develop great images. As I learn and discover great techniques, I will pass them on to you.

I mainly use the [Adobe Creative Suite](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite "Adobe Creative Suite") of programs in my design work, including: [Photoshop](http://adobe.com/photoshop "Adobe Photoshop"), Illustrator, InDesign. As for development and coding, on my Mac I use Coda2 and on my PC I use Notepad++ or Visual Studio.  I develop most of my websites on the WordPress Content Management System, which is the best and easiest to use CMS out there.

When it comes to Photography, I'm a [Nikon](http://www.nikon.com "Nikon") guy. My latest body is the D7000. I love to take environmental, lifestyle portraits, mostly family, children and seniors. I also like to take action sports shots. When it comes to post processing, I use [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/ "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom") and Photoshop.

So, if you like what you find here, drop me a comment, subscribe to my feeds and share with all of your networks! Thanks. More to come…
