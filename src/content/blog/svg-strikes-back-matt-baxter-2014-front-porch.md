SV-what?  
Scalable Vector Graphics  
or  
So very good  
  
SVG is for any illustrated vector images

- logos
- icons

Scalability

- Vector - stays crisp
- Raster - gets blurry

File Size

- SVG - 2kb
- PNG - 88kb

True resolution independence  
  
Responsive design is more than just mobile/tablet/desktop  
  
SVG is Old - 13 years  
  
Browser adoption  
The need for resolution-independent images is greater today  
Pixel density in

- 2001 = 1x
- 2014
    - 1x
    - 2x
    - 3x

SVG was made for the multi-device web  
  
Drawbacks? - NONE!  
  
If it can be SVG, it should be SVG.  
  
Creating SVGs

- Manually
- Vector programs
    - Illustrator
    - Sketch
    - Inkscape

Illustrator

- Responsive box, will remove height and width breaking it in IE

Optimize with SVGO  
  
Use SVG

- just like any other image on the web
- fallback for other browsers
    - Inline fallback
    - CSS fallback

What about icon fonts?

- Are difficult to position
- Use a single color
- Annoying to update
- Browser inconsistencies

SVG…

- Precision positioning
- Multiple colors
- simple to update
- better brewer consistency

 Start using it today!  
  
But, that's not all…  
  
The DOM

- Inject it into HTML
- Inspect with Dev Tools
- Manipulate with CSS
- CSS transitions
- Media queries
- JavaScript
    - Attach events
    - SVG.js
    - Trianglify (d3.js)

Prototype

- Wireframes
- Organize Layers and name
- Export to SVG w/responsive checked
- Load into HTML with jQuery
- Add Interactivity
    - jQuery selectors
    - Events
- Start local server
- Emulate in Chrome
- Open browser

And Much, Much, More
