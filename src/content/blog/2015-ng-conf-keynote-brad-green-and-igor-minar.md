Principles - Good caretakers of the Angular codebase and the Angular community.

Why is Angular here? Built for Google

### Evolving Angular

**Project models**

- Closed Source
- Open Source Export
- Open Source w/ community involvement (this is where Angular fits)

**ng-team**

- Continued to grow exponentially in 2015
- Companies working as partners with Google on the Core Team (i.e. Amadeus)

**v1.4 input from community**

- New Router (shared with 2.o)
- New i18n
- Better performance
- 1.4 RC0 next week

**Angular Material**

- Implement Google Material in directives
- Accessability out of the box
- Layout system based on flexbox

v1.5, v1.6... paving the path to Angular 2.0

Angularjs.org almost 1 million visitors per month

angular.io - angular 2.0 site

Continue to release 1.x until the community stops using it.

### Migration

Big Bang

- Stop 1.x and move all features into 2.0 code

Incremental

- Keep developing in 1.x, start migrating individual views
- Migrate core router and start migrating individual views

Style Guide

New Router

ES6 Modules

TypeScript types (optional)

Angular 2 Themes

- Simplicity
- Consisten
- Flexible
- Fast
- Productive

Angular 2 in alpha (angular.io)

- Not ready for production
- Are 1 and 2 similar?

### New to v2.0

- Productivity
    - AtScript - help move adoption to ES6, TypeScript and Annotations
- Standards
    - JS specifications and tc39 process

Jonathan Turner - Program Manager, TypeScript

- Collaboration between Angular Team and TypeScript Team
- TypeScript 1.5+

**AtScript name is retiring and will just be a part of TypeScript**

Language Options

- es5
- es6
- TypeScript

Why is Dart good for Angular?

- Large team working on Angular
- Learn alot from the lessons learned in Angular Dart
- Thanks to the Dart team

Enough for All

- Ember, our partner
- React
- etc.

### Simpler

Why is Angular not simple? 2.0 makes it simpler

- 4 template concepts replace 35
- Consistency
- Supported by tools
- Zones = no more $apply
- unidirectional = Predictability
- No ng-model
- Eliminate typos
- APIs mirror your needs
- Angular Loves Standards

### Performance

Benchmarks

Deep Tree speed

- Baseline = 1
- Angular 1.3 = 8.58
- Angular 2 = 3.11
- Angular 2 w/view cache = 1.44

Immutable Data Structures (new change detection system)

Angular 2 ships when?

February - Alpha

Now - Preview Angular Website

March - Google migrating first
