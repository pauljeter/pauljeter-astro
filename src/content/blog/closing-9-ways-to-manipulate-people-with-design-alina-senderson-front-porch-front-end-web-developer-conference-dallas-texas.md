Designing products  
  
Best products create lasting connections  
  
You can design for connections  
  
1\. Familiarity Bias

- Best new things use familiar patterns
- familiar patterns evoke trust
- make it easy to get to know you
- unfamiliar patterns create confusion

2\. Relative Value

- comparing is easier than appraising
- Options make us feel in control
- too many options create choice paralysis
- things that are limited have more value

3\. Bandwagon

- we are easily swayed by behaviors and opinions of others
- strength in numbers
- bandwagon can also work against you

4\. Authority

- authority can trump our own beliefs
- be strategic with placement

5\. Faith in Aesthetics

- We first judge the site by its appearance, then its content
- attractive things appear more valuable
- aesthetics affect usability

6\. Achievement

- competition is great, but we like to win
- We like challenges that are sort of challenging
- we appreciate rewards more when we don't expect them
- we like showing it off

7\. Zeigarnik Effect

- When we become engaged in a story, we have to see how it ends
- we generally like to finish what we start
- the key is getting someone to start something
- varying the length of steps keeps us motivated
- sometimes a guilt trip works best

8\. Self-Expression

- we are as unique as a snowflake
- we perceive things that we own or create as more valuable
- find ways to make the experience feel personalized
- keep personalization options small

9\. Surprise and delight

- we remember key moments in our experiences
- validate the lows
